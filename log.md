# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read up on CSS and starting code for my portfolio from the Prep Course IP. 

**Thoughts:** I really do feel like I am quite behind because I am where I was 3 months ago - but I am also very aware that if I don't start today, in X days,years I will be where I am today. Baby steps. Can't wait to see where I will e exactly one year from today.



### Day 2: October 19th 2021
**Today's Progress**: I finished my IP for creating my portfolio with a little help from Traversy's video on creating a responsive website. I've been doing this for a couple of weeks (on and off - not really my best of ways). But I have some more clarity on using Flex-box to layout images (as an option to floats). I struggled a bit here because I was putting the flex-box properties on the wrong container (not the parent container). For the same layout, i used border-box for box sizing for its direct children, and understood the object-fit CSS property better. 

I also had a look at media queries, and how I can use that for a more responsive website (mobile-first). I started on Bootstrap too, and will be going through the modules plus a task that I will begin tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Life happens, but I have to make coding a priority if I am to get better at it. 


### Day 4: October 28th 2021 (I had a couple of mental breakdowns these past few days and I have been eating myself up for it, but coming back on here, stronger)
