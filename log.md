# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read up on CSS and starting code for my portfolio from the Prep Course IP. 

**Thoughts:** I really do feel like I am quite behind because I am where I was 3 months ago - but I am also very aware that if I don't start today, in X days,years I will be where I am today. Baby steps. Can't wait to see where I will e exactly one year from today.
