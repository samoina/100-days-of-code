# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 26th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read up on CSS and starting code for my portfolio from the Prep Course IP. 

**Thoughts:** I really do feel like I am quite behind because I am where I was 3 months ago - but I am also very aware that if I don't start today, in X days,years I will be where I am today. Baby steps. Can't wait to see where I will e exactly one year from today.



### Day 2: October 19th 2021
**Today's Progress**: I finished my IP for creating my portfolio with a little help from Traversy's video on creating a responsive website. I've been doing this for a couple of weeks (on and off - not really my best of ways). But I have some more clarity on using Flex-box to layout images (as an option to floats). I struggled a bit here because I was putting the flex-box properties on the wrong container (not the parent container). For the same layout, i used border-box for box sizing for its direct children, and understood the object-fit CSS property better. 

I also had a look at media queries, and how I can use that for a more responsive website (mobile-first). I started on Bootstrap too, and will be going through the modules plus a task that I will begin tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Life happens, but I have to make coding a priority if I am to get better at it. 


### Day 4: October 28th 2021 (I had a couple of mental breakdowns these past few days and I have been eating myself up for it, but coming back on here, stronger)

### Day 5: Wednesday 10th November 2021

**Today's Progress**: I have been coding in the past few days, I just haven't been consistent with logging in that progress. I did get an extension that tracks my work yesterday, so that's motivating me to get some work done. Doing projects that will hone my HTML and CSS, once I have a basic understanding I move on to Javascript.

Today I needed to create a grid and used Bootstrap columns (but was not able to create spaces even after offsetting the columns using col-md-offset-1. Will look at this with a fresh pair of eyes)

Completed in the past few days: https://samoina.github.io/barbershop/

### Day 7: Monday 15th November 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent less than 30 minutes coding yesterday, so that doesn't really count. Last week was going well till I got my 2nd C0v1d Jab and my body just sort of slowed down. Today I continue with the baby clothes website. I could say I am getting the hang of flexbox. I also added media queries for the landing page (It makes me a littu happy when I remember how I always avoided mediaqueries because they sounded complicated. Practise I guess...). Oh, and I learnt how to add a horizontal line to HTML using <hr> and that one tiny thing makes me oh so happy.

**Thoughts**: Consistency trumps intensity. An hour's practice daily is better than 10 hours every fortnight. 


### Day 8 Tuesday 16th November 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on creating the product page for the baby shop website. Saw that I could actually do it using Flexbox so that's what I have started on. This is definitely making flexbox a lot easier to understand. I have always seeing 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink' without really understanding what that does to the children of the flex parent, so pretty stoked to see how this will go.

**Thoughts** I am so proud of myself for taking an hour to code this evening (when what I thought I would do is binge a littu on the Good Doctor). Sometimes, it doesn't feel like there's progress, but I remind myself that I am showing up, and in learning software devt, that counts (as does learning anything, really)
